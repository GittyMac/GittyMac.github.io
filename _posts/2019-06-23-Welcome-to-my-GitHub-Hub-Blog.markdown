# Hello!

***Hello World!*** So this is my first post on the Jekyll blog.

Fun Fact - I'm writing this on an Arch Linux WSL installation with Windows Terminal. Yeah.

So I'll probably make development updates and the stuff like this.

Also I'd like to tell you that this website is ***open source!!!***

So you can look at the source code. Try to find this page in it!

Well that's all for now.

Bye.
